# GSM-based-transformer-condition-monitoring-system
Developed an embedded system using Arduino, sensors, and GSM communication to monitor voltage, temperature, oil levels, and current in real-time. The system displays key metrics on an LCD and triggers alerts via SMS and buzzer when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high temperature, low oil level, or high current).
